## Motivation

Graph-structured data appears in many domains â€” social networks, biological networks, knowledge graphs, transportation networks, etc.  
Through coursework and hands-on projects, this repo aims to:

- Explore core algorithms for graphs (e.g. PageRank, diffusion)  
- Learn representation learning on graphs (embeddings, GNNs)  
- Investigate clustering and community detection in graph settings  
- Analyze graph properties like energy or spectral features  
- Compare methods and visualize results  

---

## Projects Overview

This repository currently contains notebooks for:

- **Pagerank_Fredo_Alejos.ipynb** â€” PageRank algorithm and variations  
- **Clustering_Fredo_Alejos.ipynb** â€” Clustering / community detection on graphs  
- **Diffusion_Alejos_Arrieta_Fredo.ipynb** â€” Diffusion processes on graphs  
- **Embedding_Fredo_Alejos_Arrieta.ipynb** â€” Graph embedding techniques (e.g. node2vec, spectral embeddings)  
- **GNN_Alejos_Arrieta_Fredo.ipynb** â€” Graph neural network experiments  
- (And possibly others as the course progresses)  

Each notebook includes theoretical background, code, experiments, and visualizations.

## Installation & Requirements

To run the notebooks and experiments, youâ€™ll need:

- Python (3.7+)  
- Standard data / ML libraries, e.g.  
  - `numpy`  
  - `pandas`  
  - `networkx`  
  - `scipy`  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`  
  - `scikit-learn`  
  - `torch` / `tensorflow` / `dgl` / `pyg` (depending on GNN implementation)  
- Jupyter (or JupyterLab) environment  

You can install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas networkx scipy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter torch
```

(or adjust according to your GNN framework of choice).

If you maintain a `requirements.txt`, you can use:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fredo123aaa/Graph-Learning-projects.git
   cd Graph-Learning-projects
   ```

2. Launch Jupyter:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open one of the notebooks (e.g. `GNN_Alejos_Arrieta_Fredo.ipynb`) and run cells sequentially.

4. You can modify:

   - Graph datasets used  
   - Model architectures (layers, hidden dims, aggregation functions)  
   - Hyperparameters (learning rate, epochs, regularization)  
   - Experiment settings (noise, graph perturbations, feature sets)

## Results & Visualizations

Inside each notebook youâ€™ll find:

- Graph visualizations (nodes, edges, partitions)  
- Embedding plots (2D / 3D projections)  
- Performance metrics (classification accuracy, clustering scores)  
- Comparison tables across algorithms  

If you like, we can also add sample result images to the README to showcase highlights.

## Future Directions

Some ideas to further this work:

- Apply to real-world datasets (e.g. social networks, citation networks)  
- Extend to **heterogeneous graphs** or **knowledge graphs**  
- Implement **graph contrastive learning**  
- Explore **dynamic graphs / temporal graph models**  
- Combine with **explainability** (why a GNN makes a prediction)  
- Benchmark across many graph learning libraries
